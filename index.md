Hello! Welcome to this free, online learning resource for medicinal synthesis, which is a subtopic of chemistry that concerns itself with utilizing organic synthetic methods to generate pharmaceutical molecules. 

This website aims to provide **concise**, **clear**, and **intuitive** explanations of organic synthesis that starts from the basics and progresses to more advanced topics. 

Whilst primarily targeted towards those in their undergraduate years of medicinal chemistry or pharmaceutical science degrees, this resource should also be of great use to those studying any course/major where organic chemistry is involved such as **Orgo 1/2**. 

Organic chemistry is unfortunately a daunting topic for many as per the often convoluted way it is taught. I hope that this website succeeds in presenting the content of this discipline to you in a way that is both **simple** and **approachable** no matter your skill level in chemistry!
