Hello! Welcome to this free, online learning resource for medicinal synthesis, which is a subtopic of chemistry that concerns itself with utilizing organic synthetic methods to generate pharmaceutical molecules. 

This website aims to provide **concise**, **clear**, and **intuitive** explanations of organic synthesis reactions that are used to create pharmaceutical products.

Whilst primarily targeted towards those in their undergraduate years of organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, or pharmaceutical science degrees, this resource should hopefully be of use to anyone interested in the chemistry behind how drug molecules are made.
