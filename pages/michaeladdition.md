## **Outline**
The Michael Addition is a carbonyl-based reaction whereby a **nucleophilic Michael donor** attacks the **C=C of a Michael acceptor** to **form a new C-C bond**.

The reactants needed are:
- a strong base, such as OH- or EtO-
- a Michael donor, i.e a nucleophilic enolate
- a Micheal acceptor, i.e an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl

## **Mechanistic Detail**
The below example of this reaction utilizes EtO- as the base, diethyl malonate as our Michael donor, and cyclohexenone as our Michael Acceptor.

<br>
The <ins>first step</ins> of the Michael Addition is to form our enolate nucleophile by deprotonating the a-hydrogen of the diester Michael donor.
