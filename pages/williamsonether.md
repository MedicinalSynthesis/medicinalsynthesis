## **Outline**
The Williamson-Ether synthesis is used to **form ethers** from **alkoxides** (deprotonated alcohols) and **alkyl halides** in an Sn2 fashion.

The reactants needed are:
- a **strong base**, such as hydride ions ***or*** hydroxide ions
- an **alcohol** to be deprotonated 
- an **alkyl halide**

## **Mechanistic Detail**
The below example of this reaction utilizes bromomethane and propoxide (aka - deprotonated propanol).

<br>
The <ins>first step</ins> of this reaction entails the generation of our alkoxide nucleophile using a strong base such as the H- ion, which effectively abstracts the proton from the OH group. Hydrogen gas is given off as a byproduct.

The <ins></ins>second step is an Sn2-style backside attack on the alkyl halide (in this case, bromomethane) to afford the final ether product.

## **Interesting Points**
A Williamson-Ether synthesis can also be performed intramolecularly to yield a cyclic product.

***Note** that the intermediate product from Step 1 has been redrawn in Step 2 to more clearly show the intramolecular reaction.*

## **Pharmaceutical Case Study**
<p>Guaifenesin is the active ingredient in many over-the-counter cough syrups, and works by thinning out mucus in the airways to relieve symptoms of a chesty cough.</p>
The Williamson-Ether mechanism is an important step in the synthesis of this drug molecule, as can be seen below.

***Note** the use of OH- as the strong base instead of the H- hydride ion, as was depicted previously. Conseqently, no H2 is off-gassed during the deprotonation in the first step, and water is released instead.*
