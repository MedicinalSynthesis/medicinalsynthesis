## **Outline**
The Williamson-Ether synthesis is used to **form ethers** from **alkoxides** (deprotonated alcohols) and **alkyl halides** in an Sn2 fashion.

The reactants needed are:
- a source of **hydride ions** (NaH, for example)
- an **alcohol** to be deprotonated 
- an **alkyl halide**

## **Mechanistic Detail**
The below example of this reaction utilizes bromomethane and propoxide (aka - deprotonated propanol).

The first step of this reaction entails the generation of our alkoxide nucleophile using a strong base such as the H- ion, which effectively abstracts the proton from the OH group. Hydrogen gas is given off as a byproduct.

The second step is an Sn2-style backside attack on the alkyl halide (in this case, bromomethane) to afford the final ether product.

## **Interesting Points**
A Williamson-Ether synthesis can also be performed intramolecularly to yield a cyclic product.
