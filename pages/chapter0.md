## A Very Brief Introduction
Before we begin with our treatment of medicinal synthesis, it would be prudent for me to briefly explain how this website and its content is set out. 

Each chapter will contain a particular subset of content, starting with an outline of what will be taught, an overall explanation of the designated topic, and finishing with a statement of the contents relevance to the generation of pharmaceuticals and/or the broader scope of organic chemistry. This way, you can see the tangible relevance of what you have just learnt AND what the point was of learning it.

We will begin with the first three chapters (Basics I, Basics II, Basics III), which will cover every single basic principle you must be skilled and confident in to succeed in organic chemistry/medicinal synthesis. There is a bit to cover, hence why I have split it into three 'Basics' chapters to make it a bit more digestible. Although some prior experience in general chemistry is useful, everything will be explained from scratch.

Best of luck.
