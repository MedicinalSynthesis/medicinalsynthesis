## The Basics I
In this chapter, we will begin our foray into medicinal synthesis by first establishing some basic chemical principles such as atomic structure, electron configuration, electronegativity, polar vs nonpolar, orbitals, hybridization, bond-angles, valence bond theory, and intermolecular forces. This may seem like a lot, but don't worry - we will only be covering the aspects of these concepts that are relevant to organic chemistry which shrinks down our scope considerably.

Let's begin!
