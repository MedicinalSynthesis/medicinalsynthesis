## The Basics I - Outline
In this chapter, we will begin our foray into medicinal synthesis by first establishing some basic chemical principles such as atomic structure, electron configuration, electronegativity, polar vs nonpolar, orbitals, hybridization, bond-angles, valence bond theory, and intermolecular forces. This may seem like a lot, but don't worry - we will only be covering the aspects of these concepts that are relevant to organic chemistry which shrinks down our scope considerably.

Let's begin!

## Atomic Structure

Although it is assumed you have some degree of familiarity in very basic chemistry, we will give a run-through again from scratch so we're all on the same page. 

All matter in the universe is made up of very small particles called atoms. 

Atoms are made up of positively charged protons, neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons. 

The protons and neutrons sit together in what is known as the nucleus at the centre of the atom, and the electrons exist outside the nucleus in what we call 'shells' (its a bit more complicated than this, but we'll get there). 

Atoms can have differing numbers of protons, and the number of protons gives the atom its elemental identity. For example, an atom with 6 protons is considered to be the element carbon, and an atom with 8 protons is of the element oxygen. 

Atoms are electrically-neutral, which basically means that when we consider an element's atom off the periodic table before it has undergone any form of chemical transformation, its number of protons will equal its number of electrons. So if I take carbon off of the periodic table (a chart tabulating all existing elements in the universe), I can see that its atomic number (number of protons in a single carbon atom) is 6. Thus, I have 6 electrons in the atom too, as 6 negative electrons will offset the positivity from the 6 positive protons.

Each proton weighs 1 amu (atomic mass unit) and each neutron weighs 1 amu as well. Electrons weigh practically nothing and do not contribute any meaningful mass to the atom. 

If we look at carbon off of the periodic table, it can be seen that the mass number of a single carbon atom is 12 amu, which basically means that the number of protons + neutrons in a carbon atom is equal to 12. We know that carbon has 6 protons courtesy of its atomic number of 6, and that each proton weighs 1 amu, so thus we have accounted for 6 amu from the total atomic mass number of 12 amu. Hence, the remaining 6 amu (12 - 6) must be from the neutrons - therefore there are 6 neutrons in the carbon atom. 

So mass number (protons + neutrons) - atomic number (protons) equals number of neutrons in an atom. Awesome! 

To also keep in mind, the number of neutrons present in an atom of a single element can vary. For example, Carbon mainly exists with a mass number of 12 and thus has 6 neutrons - however, a very small fraction of carbon atoms in a given sample may have a mass number of 13 and thus have 7 neutrons (13 - 6 = 7). This is called an ISOTOPE. 

Isotopes/neutrons do play a very important role in organic chemistry/medicinal synthesis which will be explored later, but they are not nearly as important nor pivotal as the role that electrons play. So remember that isotopes exist, but fret not about their significance currently.

And just like that, we have covered the basics of atomic structure.
