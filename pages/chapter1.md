## The Basics I - Outline
In this chapter, we will begin our foray into medicinal synthesis by first establishing some basic chemical principles such as atomic structure, electron configuration, electronegativity, polar vs nonpolar, orbitals, hybridization, bond-angles, valence bond theory, and intermolecular forces. This may seem like a lot, but don't worry - we will only be covering the aspects of these concepts that are relevant to organic chemistry which shrinks down our scope considerably.

Let's begin!

## Atomic Structure

Although it is assumed you have some degree of familiarity in very basic chemistry, we will give a run-through again so we're all on the same page. 

All matter in the universe is made up of very small particles called atoms. 

Atoms are made up of positively charged protons, neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons. 

The protons and neutrons sit together in what is known as the nucleus at the centre of the atom, and the electrons exist outside the nucleus in what we call 'shells' (its a bit more complicated than this, but we'll get there). 

Atoms can have differing numbers of protons, and the number of protons gives the atom its elemental identity. For example, an atom with 6 protons is considered to be the element carbon, and an atom with 8 protons is of the element oxygen. 

Atoms are electrically-neutral, which basically means that when we consider an element's atom off the periodic table before it has undergone any form of chemical transformation, its number of protons will equal its number of electrons. So if I take carbon off of the periodic table, I can see that its atomic number (number of protons in a single carbon atom) is 6. Thus, I have 6 electrons in the atom too, as 6 negative electrons will offset the positivity from the 6 positive protons.
