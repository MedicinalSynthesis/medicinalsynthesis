## The Basics I - Outline
In this chapter, we will begin our foray into medicinal synthesis by first establishing some basic chemical principles such as atomic structure, electron configuration, electronegativity, polar vs nonpolar, orbitals, hybridization, bond-angles, valence bond theory, and intermolecular forces. This may seem like a lot, but don't worry - we will only be covering the aspects of these concepts that are relevant to organic chemistry which shrinks down our scope considerably.

Let's begin!

## Atomic Structure

Although it is assumed you have some degree of familiarity in very basic chemistry, we will give a run-through again from scratch so we're all on the same page. 

All matter in the universe is made up of very small particles called atoms. 

Atoms are made up of positively charged protons, neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons. 

The protons and neutrons sit together in what is known as the nucleus at the centre of the atom, and the electrons exist outside the nucleus in what we call 'shells' (its a bit more complicated than this, but we'll get there). 

Atoms can have differing numbers of protons within them, and the number of protons gives the atom its elemental identity. For example, an atom with 6 protons is considered to be the element carbon, and an atom with 8 protons is of the element oxygen. 

Atoms are electrically-neutral, which basically means that when we consider an element's atom off the periodic table (a chart tabulating all existing elements in the universe) before it has undergone any form of chemical transformation, its number of protons will equal its number of electrons. 

So if I take carbon off of the periodic table , I can see that its atomic number (number of protons in a single carbon atom) is 6. Thus, I have 6 electrons in the atom too, as 6 negative electrons will offset the positivity from the 6 positive protons.

Each proton weighs 1 amu (atomic mass unit) and each neutron weighs 1 amu as well. Electrons weigh practically nothing and do not contribute any meaningful mass to the atom. 

If we look at carbon off of the periodic table, it can be seen that the mass number of a single carbon atom is 12 amu, which basically means that the number of protons + neutrons in a carbon atom is equal to 12. We know that carbon has 6 protons courtesy of its atomic number of 6, and that each proton weighs 1 amu, so thus we have accounted for 6 amu from the total atomic mass number of 12 amu. Hence, the remaining 6 amu (12 - 6) must be from the neutrons - therefore there are 6 neutrons in the carbon atom. 

So mass number (protons + neutrons) - atomic number (protons) equals number of neutrons in an atom. Awesome! 

To also keep in mind, the number of neutrons present in an atom of a single element can vary. For example, Carbon mainly exists with a mass number of 12 and thus has 6 neutrons - however, a very small fraction of carbon atoms in a given sample may have a mass number of 13 and thus have 7 neutrons (13 - 6 = 7). This is called an ISOTOPE. 

Isotopes/neutrons do play a very important role in organic chemistry/medicinal synthesis which will be explored later, but they are not nearly as important nor pivotal as the role that electrons play. So remember that isotopes exist, but fret not about their significance currently.

And just like that, we have covered the basics of atomic structure.

## Electrons, Electron Configurations, and Bonding

Now, let's take a deeper dive into those electrons that we mentioned earlier. 

What we are about to tell you is a very important point, and could arguably be considered the crux of all organic/medicinal chemistry, so pay attention. 

Ready? 

***Electrons in an atom are the most important determinant in chemical reactivity.***

So, this is a good sign to pay extra attention to this subtopic as we will go through this imperative topic slowly and intuitively, as without a solid grasp of electrons you are likely to struggle quite heavily.

As carbon is the single most important element in the study of medicinal synthesis, we will use this as our example atom to explore electrons further. Of course, the principles you are about to learn apply to essentially every element in the periodic table.

Recall that since carbon has an atomic number of 6, we have 6 protons, and to maintain electric neutrality we therefore have 6 electrons in the atom.

Now, these electrons don't just exist arbritrarily around the nucleus of the carbon atom.

Electrons in every single atom of every single element are arranged into energy levels called shells, and are then further arranged into subshells and finally orbitals.

Think of the shells as the suburbs where electrons live in. The subshell is then the house in that suburb, and the orbitals are the rooms within that house. 

The first shell can fit 2 electrons in it.

The second shell can fit 8 electrons in it.

The third shell can fit 18 electrons in it.

And that's all we will consider for the moment in our study of medicinal synthesis, as rarely will we encounter atoms in this field that contain a number of electrons that makes us need to consider beyond the third shell. This is a matter for other disciplines.

Now, the first shell contains ONE subshell called the 's' subshell, and within this 's' subshell is ONE orbital.

The second shell contains TWO subshells, an 's' subshell, and another called the 'p' subshell. The 's' subshell once again holds ONE orbital, and the 'p' subshell will hold THREE orbitals.

Lastly, the third shell contains THREE subshells, an 's' subshell, a 'p' subshell, and now a 'd' subshell as well. The 's' subshell again holds ONE orbital, the 'p' subshell holds THREE orbitals, and the 'd' subshell will hold FIVE orbitals. Every orbital will hold 2 electrons.

Right now, this seems as nothing more than a lot of rote memorization work and countless subdivisions to spread our electrons around in. This work will pay off however in the long run, and we will complete something called an electron filling diagram with this information using the carbon atom as promised. 

So, back to carbon.

This has 6 electrons total, so lets start simple and work out how many electrons will go into each shell.

Two of the total six electrons will move into the FIRST shell, as recall that this can fit 2 electrons maximum. Thus, we have 4 electrons leftover, which will fit snugly into the second shell as this can hold 8 maximum electrons. So, the first shell has thus been *fully filled*, and our second shell has had 4 electrons filled out of the maximum 8. 

**We call our second shell the 'valence' electron shell, and the electrons within this particular shell 'valence electrons', because they are in the OUTERMOST OCCUPIED ELECTRON SHELL OF THE ATOM.** 

This statement was not bolded nor capitalized for no reason. This is an essential concept to understand because it is the valence electrons that will underpin chemical reactivity.

Now that we have established how many electrons will go into each shell, and what our valence shell is, we can now start determining into which subshells and orbitals the electrons in each shell will move into.

The easiest and most intuitive way to do this is by using an electron filling diagram, an example of which is shown below.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

This allows us to chart exactly WHERE in each shell the electrons are going. Each square represents an orbital, and each row a subshell. The terms '1s' or '2s' refer to the shell and subshell that the orbital is in. For example, the '2p' designation means that we are referring to the SECOND shell and the P subshell.

To start, lets fill in the electrons that fit within the first shell, for which we deduced earlier that there would be two electrons.

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

Note that each arrow, no matter whether it is pointing up or down, represents a single electron. Electrons are always drawn out in pairs in each orbital, with one arrow pointing up and another pointing down. At this stage, you do not need to understand the significance of the direction of the arrows, other than that when two electrons pair up, one is something called 'spin-up' and another is something called 'spin-down'.

Let's keep going. 

Take a moment and notice how the squares (or orbitals) are arranged in LEVELS, with the 2s orbital above the 1s orbital, the 2p orbitals above the 2s orbital, and so forth. 

When we fill in electrons in a shell with multiple subshells (like how the second shell has S and P subshells), we start by placing electrons from the lower levels until the orbitals are all filled, and then moving to the higher levels. When there are multiple orbitals on the same level (i.e squares in a row such as for the 2p subshell), we start by placing one electron (with the arrow pointing up) in each box BEFORE beginning to pair them up.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so you might understand this concept more intuitively from the finished Carbon electron diagram below.
